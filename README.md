# Note
The source code for the Invite Rewards discord bot.
I am aware that the source code is messy in some places, with some potentially sensitive credentials being exposed. These credentials are no longer valid, so no, you cannot log into the official bot.

If you decide to use the bot, please ‚≠êstar the repo. It is greatly appreciated.

# Documentation
Documentation coming soon. Contact localhost5173 via the [support server](https://discord.com/invite/7Q9nheNq2M) if you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them.
